This is react app which makes use of Bands In Town API to fetch data about artists and the locations of the venues where they are performing. 

The app is completely responsive. I have used material's library for the UI components and responsiveness. Due to time constraints, I cannot add the feature of cache. As far as deployment is concerned, we can deploy the app using surge or netlify, both of which are free.
